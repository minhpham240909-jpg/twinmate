# Deployment Status Check

**Date:** October 31, 2025 (Updated after system prompt fix)

## Current Situation

### ‚úÖ TWO CRITICAL FIXES DEPLOYED:
**Root Cause #1:** The AI agent didn't know WHEN to call matchCandidates!
**Root Cause #2:** Conversation history poisoned the AI's responses after first request!

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Conversation History Poisoning Fix** (commit `4e5b8e5`) ‚≠ê‚≠ê CRITICAL
   - Fixed: AI worked once, then failed on subsequent requests in same conversation
   - Root cause: Conversation history saved incorrect responses, AI repeated them
   - Added RULE 8: Ignore incorrect previous responses
   - Added warning: Apply rules to EVERY message regardless of history
   - Now AI treats each request fresh even with bad conversation history

2. **System Prompt Update** (commit `661e032`) ‚≠ê CRITICAL
   - Fixed: AI didn't know WHEN to call matchCandidates
   - Added RULE 5: Partner matching detection with explicit trigger patterns
   - Added RULE 6: Instructions for after finding matches
   - Added RULE 7: Never say "no partners" without calling tool first

3. **Diagnostic Logging** (commit `b6beef4`)
   - Added comprehensive logging to matchCandidates tool
   - Shows which user, profile data, candidates found, scores

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- All code fixes are complete and pushed to GitHub
- Database queries work correctly (tested locally)
- bao pham profile is complete with 3 subjects, 2 interests
- matchCandidates returns 3 matches (48%, 33%, 33%)
- **AI now knows to call matchCandidates when user asks for partners**

### üìã Recent Commits:
1. `4e5b8e5` - **Fix conversation history poisoning** ‚≠ê‚≠ê CRITICAL FIX #2
2. `661e032` - **Add explicit matchCandidates trigger rules** ‚≠ê CRITICAL FIX #1
3. `b6beef4` - Add diagnostic logging to matchCandidates
4. `200135f` - Add deployment check endpoint
5. `b4ce546` - Add helpful self-search message

## Possible Causes:

1. **Vercel Project Paused/Deleted**
   - Check Vercel dashboard to see if project exists
   - May need to reconnect GitHub repo

2. **Domain Issue**
   - Custom domain not configured
   - Need actual Vercel deployment URL

3. **Build Failure**
   - Check Vercel dashboard for failed builds
   - May need to check build logs

## Next Steps:

### Option 1: Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find the "twinmate" or "clerva-app" project
3. Check deployment status
4. Look for any errors or warnings

### Option 2: Get Actual Deployment URL
The actual deployment might be at a different URL like:
- `https://clerva-app-xxx.vercel.app`
- `https://twinmate-xxx.vercel.app`

### Option 3: Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard
If deployment failed, trigger a new deployment from the dashboard.

## Testing When Deployment Works:

Once site is live, test with bao pham account:
1. Login as bao pham (clervaclever@gmail.com)
2. Open AI agent
3. Type: "Find me a study partner"
4. Expected behavior:
   - AI reads RULE 5 from system prompt
   - AI recognizes "find me a partner" pattern
   - AI IMMEDIATELY calls matchCandidates(limit=10)
   - AI receives 3 matches from tool
   - AI presents the 3 matches to user

Should work because:
- ‚úÖ Profile is complete (3 subjects, 2 interests, bio, school)
- ‚úÖ matchCandidates tool fixed (minScore=0.1, fallback logic)
- ‚úÖ Returns matches with 10% threshold
- ‚úÖ Fallback returns top candidates
- ‚úÖ **System prompt now has explicit rules telling AI to call matchCandidates**

## What Changed (The Real Fix):

**Before:** System prompt only said "Match students with compatible study partners" - no trigger patterns!
**After:** System prompt has RULE 5 with explicit patterns like:
- "find me a partner" ‚Üí call matchCandidates
- "looking for study buddy" ‚Üí call matchCandidates
- "who can I study with" ‚Üí call matchCandidates

This mirrors the successful searchUsers rules that already worked correctly.
