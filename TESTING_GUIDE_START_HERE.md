## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Problem: No toast notification**

**Check 1:** Open browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
- Look for red error messages
- Common error: `Supabase is not defined`

**Fix 1:** Check `.env.local` file has:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Check 2:** Is User A on the correct tab?
- User A must be on "Timer" tab (NOT Chat)
- If User A is on Chat tab, no toast will show (by design)

---

### **Problem: No sound**

**Check 1:** Browser autoplay policy
- Click anywhere on the page first
- Then have User B send message again

**Check 2:** Computer volume
- Is computer muted?
- Is browser tab muted? (look for speaker icon on tab)

**Check 3:** Browser permissions
- Some browsers block audio autoplay
- Solution: User A must click/interact with page first

---

### **Problem: No red badge**

**Check 1:** Browser console
- F12 ‚Üí Console tab
- Look for React errors

**Check 2:** Refresh the page
- User A: Refresh browser (Cmd+R or Ctrl+R)
- Try sending message again

**Check 3:** Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

---

### **Problem: Badge doesn't disappear**

**Expected:** Badge should disappear when User A clicks "Chat" tab

**If it doesn't disappear:**
