# üîç AI Agent Partner Matching - Complete Diagnosis

## Executive Summary

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

The `matchCandidates` tool is **fully functional** and returns correct results. However, the AI agent is **not calling it** because the system prompt lacks explicit instructions about when to use this tool.

---

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Test 1: Database Check
```
‚úÖ Found 4 users in database:
   1. bao pham (clervaclever@gmail.com)
   2. Gia Khang Ph·∫°m (giakhangpham94@gmail.com)
   3. Gia Khang Ph·∫°m (giakhang.pham@example.com)
   4. Minh Pham (minhpham240909@gmail.com)

‚úÖ All users have profiles
‚úÖ 3 potential partners exist for any given user
```

### ‚úÖ Test 2: Tool Functionality
```
Tool: matchCandidates
Input: { userId: "2f8dc3ae-fb4d-4d65-abf0-b10714228120", limit: 10, minScore: 0.1 }

OUTPUT:
‚úÖ 3 matches found successfully
   - Gia Khang Ph·∫°m: 48.4% compatibility
   - Minh Pham: 33.3% compatibility
   - Gia Khang Ph·∫°m: 33.3% compatibility

LOGS:
[matchCandidates] Profile: found: true, subjects: 3
[matchCandidates] Candidates found: 3
[matchCandidates] Scored: 3 Filtered: 3
[matchCandidates] RETURN: 3 matches

CONCLUSION: Tool works perfectly! ‚úÖ
```

### ‚úÖ Test 3: Tool Registration
```
‚úÖ matchCandidates is registered in ToolRegistry
‚úÖ Tool is available to AI agent
‚úÖ Tool description exists
```

## üî¥ The Problem

### Root Cause: Missing System Prompt Instructions

**Location**: `packages/ai-agent/src/lib/orchestrator.ts` (line 486-560)

The system prompt has **explicit rules for searchUsers** but **NO rules for matchCandidates**:

#### What EXISTS (searchUsers):
```typescript
üî¥ CRITICAL SEARCH RULES - FOLLOW WITHOUT EXCEPTION üî¥

‚ö†Ô∏è RULE 1 - NAME SEARCH DETECTION:
If user message contains ANY of these patterns ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY call searchUsers tool:
  ‚úì A capitalized word that could be a name: "John", "Sarah", "Minh", "Alex"
  ‚úì Phrases: "find [name]", "search for [name]", "who is [name]"
  
EXAMPLES REQUIRING searchUsers TOOL:
  - User: "John" ‚Üí YOU: Call searchUsers(query="John", searchBy="name")
  - User: "find Minh" ‚Üí YOU: Call searchUsers(query="Minh", searchBy="name")
```

#### What's MISSING (matchCandidates):
```
‚ùå NO explicit rules for when to call matchCandidates
‚ùå NO examples of partner matching queries
‚ùå NO instruction to use matchCandidates for "find partner" requests
```

The only mention is vague:
```typescript
- Match students with compatible study partners using REAL database data
10. For partner matching: check strengths/weaknesses, online status, and availability
```

This is NOT explicit enough for the AI to know:
- WHEN to call matchCandidates
- WHAT user queries should trigger it
- HOW to use it properly

---

## Why This Matters

### User Says: "Find me a study partner"

**What SHOULD happen:**
1. AI sees "find partner" keyword
2. AI calls `matchCandidates` tool
3. Tool returns 3 matches
4. AI presents matches to user

**What ACTUALLY happens:**
1. AI sees "find partner"
2. AI has no explicit rule to call matchCandidates
3. AI decides not to call any tool (or calls searchUsers instead)
4. AI says "I cannot find a partner in database"

---

## üéØ The Fix

### Add Explicit matchCandidates Rules to System Prompt

Add this section to `buildSystemPrompt()` after the searchUsers rules:

```typescript
‚ö†Ô∏è RULE 5 - PARTNER MATCHING DETECTION:
If user message contains ANY of these patterns ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY call matchCandidates tool:
  ‚úì "find partner", "find study partner", "match me", "find someone to study with"
  ‚úì "who can I study with", "study partners for [subject]"
  ‚úì "find compatible partners", "match me with someone"
  ‚úì "who should I study with", "recommend study partners"

EXAMPLES REQUIRING matchCandidates TOOL:
  - User: "find me a study partner" ‚Üí YOU: Call matchCandidates({ limit: 10 })
  - User: "who can I study with" ‚Üí YOU: Call matchCandidates({ limit: 10 })
  - User: "find partners for Math" ‚Üí YOU: Call matchCandidates({ limit: 10 }) then filter by subject
  - User: "match me with someone" ‚Üí YOU: Call matchCandidates({ limit: 10 })

‚ö†Ô∏è RULE 6 - AFTER FINDING MATCHES:
After matchCandidates returns results:
  ‚Üí Use searchUsers to get full details about each match
  ‚Üí Use matchInsight to explain WHY they're compatible
  ‚Üí Use getOnlineUsers to check who's available NOW
  ‚Üí Present ALL matches, not just the top one
```

---

## Verification Steps

### Before Fix:
```bash
# User asks: "find me a study partner"
# Expected: AI should call matchCandidates
# Actual: AI says "cannot find partners"
```

### After Fix:
```bash
# User asks: "find me a study partner"
# Expected: AI calls matchCandidates ‚Üí returns 3 matches
# Actual: Should work! ‚úÖ
```

---

## Additional Findings

### 1. Tool Description Could Be Better

Current tool description:
```typescript
description: 'Find and rank potential study partners based on compatibility 
(subjects, learning style, availability). Returns top matches even with low 
compatibility scores.'
```

**Issue**: Generic description doesn't help AI know when to use it

**Better description**:
```typescript
description: `üî¥ PARTNER MATCHING TOOL - Use when user wants study partners üî¥

‚ö†Ô∏è CALL THIS TOOL when user says:
- "find me a partner" / "find study partner"
- "who can I study with" / "match me with someone"
- "find partners for [subject]"
- ANY request about finding compatible study partners

This tool:
‚úÖ Searches ALL users in database
‚úÖ Calculates compatibility scores
‚úÖ Returns top matches (even if scores are low)
‚úÖ Includes facets: commonSubjects, studyStyleMatch, skillLevelMatch

Input: { limit?: number (default 10), minScore?: number (default 0.1) }
Output: { matches: [{userId, score, facets}], total: number }`
```

### 2. searchUsers vs matchCandidates Confusion

**Problem**: Two similar tools with overlapping use cases

- `searchUsers` - Find specific users by name/subject
- `matchCandidates` - Find compatible partners based on profile

**The AI might be confused about which to use!**

**Solution**: Make it crystal clear in the prompt:
```
Use searchUsers when: User wants a SPECIFIC person ("find John", "who is Sarah")
Use matchCandidates when: User wants COMPATIBLE partners ("find study partner", "who can I study with")
```

## Files to Modify

### 1. System Prompt (CRITICAL)
**File**: `packages/ai-agent/src/lib/orchestrator.ts`  
**Line**: Around 500-560 (buildSystemPrompt method)  
**Change**: Add explicit matchCandidates rules (see "The Fix" section above)

### 2. Tool Description (RECOMMENDED)
**File**: `packages/ai-agent/src/tools/matchCandidates.ts`  
**Line**: 18 (description field)  
**Change**: Make description more explicit with examples

## Summary

| Component | Status | Issue |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Database | ‚úÖ Working | Users exist, profiles complete |
| matchCandidates Tool | ‚úÖ Working | Returns 3 matches correctly |
| Tool Registration | ‚úÖ Working | Tool is available to AI |
| **System Prompt** | ‚ùå **MISSING** | **No explicit rules for matchCandidates** |
| Tool Description | ‚ö†Ô∏è Could be better | Too generic, no examples |

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **DONE**: Identified root cause
2. ‚è∏Ô∏è **TODO**: Add explicit matchCandidates rules to system prompt
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è **TODO**: Improve tool description
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è **TODO**: Test with real user queries
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è **TODO**: Deploy and verify in production

---

## Test Commands

```bash
# Test the tool directly (already working)
node test-ai-agent-live.js

# Test the full matching flow
node test-matching-diagnosis.js

# After fix, test with actual AI agent:
# 1. Start dev server: npm run dev
# 2. Open chat interface
# 3. Type: "find me a study partner"
# 4. Check server logs for [matchCandidates] calls
# 5. Verify AI returns the 3 matches
```

---

## Conclusion

**The issue is NOT with the database or tool functionality.**  
**The issue is with the AI agent's instructions.**

The AI doesn't know WHEN to use matchCandidates because:
1. No explicit rules in system prompt (like searchUsers has)
2. Tool description is too generic
3. No clear distinction between searchUsers and matchCandidates

**Fix Priority**: HIGH  
**Fix Complexity**: EASY (just add text to prompt)  
**Expected Time**: 10 minutes

Once the system prompt is updated with explicit rules, the AI will call matchCandidates correctly and users will see their 3 potential partners! ‚úÖ
