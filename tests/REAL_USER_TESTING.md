# üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Phase 3: Testing with REAL Users

**Goal:** Test AI agent with real people, not fake test data
**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Progress:** 97% ‚Üí 100%

---

## üéØ Why Test with Real Users?

Testing with **real users** gives you:
- ‚úÖ Actual user behavior and interactions
- ‚úÖ Real study content and documents
- ‚úÖ Authentic partner matching scenarios
- ‚úÖ True performance measurements
- ‚úÖ Real-world edge cases

---

## üìä STEP 1: Check Your Current Users (5 minutes)

### 1.1 Count Real Users

**Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:**
```sql
-- How many real users exist?
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_users FROM "User";

-- List recent users
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  email,
  role,
  "emailVerified",
  "createdAt"
FROM "User"
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Result:**
- **If 0 users:** Go to Step 2 (Create Real Accounts)
- **If 1-2 users:** Go to Step 3 (You need more users for partner matching)
- **If 3+ users:** Go to Step 4 (Ready to test!) ‚úÖ

---

## üìä STEP 2: Create Real Accounts (If Needed)

### Option A: Sign Up Through App (Recommended)

**Create 3-5 real accounts:**

**Account 1: Your Main Account**
1. Go to: https://clerva-noihcq47v-minh-phams-projects-2df8ca7e.vercel.app/auth/signup
2. Sign up with your real email
3. Verify email
4. Complete profile:
   - Name: Your real name
   - Subjects: Computer Science, Math, etc.
   - Interests: AI, Coding, etc.
   - Study style: Visual/Auditory/etc.
   - Availability: Set real time windows

**Account 2-3: Friends/Family**
1. Ask 2-3 friends to create accounts
2. Have them fill in real profiles
3. Use different subjects for partner matching tests

**Account 4-5: Alt Accounts (Optional)**
1. Create alt accounts with different emails
2. Use real study interests
3. Set different availability times

---

### Option B: Quick Real Accounts via SQL

**If you want to quickly create real-looking accounts:**

```sql
-- Replace with YOUR real information
DO $$
DECLARE
  user_id UUID;
BEGIN
  -- Create your main account
  INSERT INTO "User" (id, name, email, "passwordHash", "emailVerified", role, "createdAt", "updatedAt")
  VALUES (
    gen_random_uuid(),
    'YOUR_REAL_NAME',              -- ‚Üê Change this
    'your.real.email@gmail.com',   -- ‚Üê Change this
    '$2a$10$dummyHashForTestingOnly1234567890',
    true,
    'PREMIUM',
    NOW(),
    NOW()
  )
  RETURNING id INTO user_id;

  -- Create profile with YOUR real subjects/interests
  INSERT INTO "Profile" (
    id, "userId", bio, subjects, interests, goals,
    "studyStyle", "skillLevel", "onlineStatus",
    "isLookingForPartner", "availableDays", "availableHours",
    "createdAt", "updatedAt"
  )
  VALUES (
    gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id,
    'YOUR_REAL_BIO',                                    -- ‚Üê Change this
    ARRAY['Computer Science', 'Mathematics'],           -- ‚Üê Your real subjects
    ARRAY['AI', 'Programming', 'Gaming'],               -- ‚Üê Your real interests
    ARRAY['Master full-stack', 'Build AI projects'],   -- ‚Üê Your real goals
    'VISUAL',                                           -- ‚Üê Your learning style
    'INTERMEDIATE',                                     -- ‚Üê Your skill level
    'ONLINE',
    true,
    ARRAY['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday'],           -- ‚Üê Your availability
    ARRAY['14:00-17:00', '19:00-21:00'],              -- ‚Üê Your time windows
    NOW(),
    NOW()
  );

  -- Set online
  INSERT INTO "presence" (user_id, is_online, last_seen)
  VALUES (user_id, true, NOW())
  ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET is_online = true, last_seen = NOW();

  RAISE NOTICE 'Created real user account: %', user_id;
END $$;
```

**Repeat 2-3 times with different:**
- Names (friends, family, or yourself with different accounts)
- Email addresses
- Subjects (to test partner matching)
- Availability (some online, some offline)

---

## üìä STEP 3: Verify Real User Setup

**Check profiles are complete:**
```sql
SELECT
  u.id,
  u.name,
  u.email,
  p.subjects,
  p.interests,
  p."onlineStatus",
  pr.is_online,
  p."availableDays"
FROM "User" u
LEFT JOIN "Profile" p ON u.id = p."userId"
LEFT JOIN "presence" pr ON u.id = pr.user_id
ORDER BY u."createdAt" DESC;
```
