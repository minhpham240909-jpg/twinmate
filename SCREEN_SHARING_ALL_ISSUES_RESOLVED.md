# Screen Sharing - All Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

## Summary of All Issues Fixed

This document covers ALL three screen sharing issues that were encountered and how they were resolved.

---

## Issue #1: Multiple Video Tracks Error ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
```
AgoraRTCError CAN_NOT_PUBLISH_MULTIPLE_VIDEO_TRACKS
```

### Cause
Agora SDK doesn't allow publishing camera video and screen share video at the same time.

### Solution
Unpublish camera video before publishing screen share, then re-publish it when screen sharing stops.

### Code Change
**File**: `src/lib/hooks/useVideoCall.ts`

```typescript
// In startScreenShare():
// 1. Create screen share track first
const screenTrackResult = await createScreenShareTrack()

// 2. Then unpublish camera video
const videoTrack = localTracksRef.current.videoTrack
if (videoTrack) {
  await agoraClient.unpublish([videoTrack])
}

// In stopScreenShare():
// Re-publish camera video when done
if (videoTrack && localVideoEnabled) {
  await agoraClient.publish([videoTrack])
}
```

### Result
‚úÖ Screen sharing works without multiple video track errors

---

## Issue #2: User Gesture Handler Error ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
```
AgoraRTCError PERMISSION_DENIED:
InvalidStateError: getDisplayMedia must be called from a user gesture handler.
```

### Cause
Browser requires `getDisplayMedia()` to be called **immediately** after user action. Having an `await` operation before the screen share request broke this requirement.

### Solution
Call `createScreenShareTrack()` FIRST (immediately after button click), then handle other operations afterwards.

### Code Change
**Before** (broken):
```typescript
// Check conditions
await agoraClient.unpublish([videoTrack])  // ‚ùå Delay breaks gesture chain
const screenTrackResult = await createScreenShareTrack()  // Too late!
```

**After** (fixed):
```typescript
// Check conditions
const screenTrackResult = await createScreenShareTrack()  // ‚úÖ Immediate!
await agoraClient.unpublish([videoTrack])  // Now safe to delay
```

### Result
‚úÖ Screen share permission request works immediately after button click

---

## Issue #3: User Cancelled Permission ‚úÖ HANDLED

### Problem
```
AgoraRTCError PERMISSION_DENIED: NotAllowedError:
The request is not allowed by the user agent or the platform in the current context,
possibly because the user denied permission.
```

### Cause
This error appears when:
1. User clicks "Cancel" on the screen share picker
2. User denies permission
3. Browser blocks the request

**This is NORMAL user behavior** - not an actual error!

### Solution
Detect when user cancels and handle it gracefully without showing error messages.

### Code Change
```typescript
catch (error) {
  let errorMessage = 'Failed to start screen sharing'
  let showError = true

  if (error && typeof error === 'object' && 'name' in error) {
    if (error.name === 'NotAllowedError' || error.name === 'PermissionDeniedError') {
      // User clicked "Cancel" - this is normal, don't show error
      errorMessage = 'Screen sharing cancelled'
      showError = false
      console.log('User cancelled screen sharing')
    } else if (error.name === 'NotSupportedError') {
      errorMessage = 'Screen sharing is not supported in this browser.'
    } else if (error.name === 'InvalidStateError') {
      errorMessage = 'Cannot start screen sharing at this time. Please try again.'
    }
  }

  // Only show error toast if it's an actual error
  if (showError) {
    toast.error(errorMessage)
  }

  setIsScreenSharing(false)
}
```

### Result
‚úÖ User cancellation is handled gracefully without error messages
‚úÖ Real errors still show appropriate messages
‚úÖ Better user experience

## Complete Flow Now Working

### Starting Screen Share:

```
1. User clicks screen share button or presses 'S'
   ‚Üì
2. Check if already sharing (instant)
   ‚Üì
3. Check if someone else sharing (instant)
   ‚Üì
4. Check if connected (instant)
   ‚Üì
5. Request screen share permission (immediate!) üñ•Ô∏è
   ‚Üì
   Browser shows picker:
   - Share Entire Screen
   - Share Window
   - Share Tab
   ‚Üì
6a. User selects and clicks "Share" ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
    - Unpublish camera video

## Browser Compatibility

## Performance Impact

- **Bandwidth**: ~1-3 Mbps for 1080p screen share
- **CPU**: Low (screen capture is hardware-accelerated)
- **Memory**: +50-100MB during screen share
- **Battery**: Moderate impact on laptops

**Optimization**: Screen share uses 15fps (vs 30fps for camera) to save bandwidth

---

## User Privacy

When sharing screen:
- ‚úÖ User chooses what to share (screen/window/tab)
- ‚úÖ Browser shows clear indicator that sharing is active
- ‚úÖ User can stop anytime (button or browser's stop button)
- ‚úÖ Notifications are visible if sharing entire screen (privacy concern)
- ‚úÖ Other windows hidden if sharing specific window (more private)

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not currently implemented):
1. Quality selector (1080p, 720p, 480p)
2. System audio sharing toggle
3. Annotation/pointer tools
4. "Request permission to share" feature
5. Recording capability
6. Share specific application by name
