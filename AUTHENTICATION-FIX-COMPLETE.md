# Authentication Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
The profile save (and all other API functions) were failing with "Internal server error" because:
1. The signin flow was storing sessions in localStorage only
2. The server-side API routes need cookies to authenticate users
3. There was no mechanism to sync the localStorage session to server-readable cookies

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Session Sync Utility (`src/lib/auth/session-sync.ts`)
- Reads Supabase session from localStorage
- Writes access and refresh tokens to cookies
- Runs automatically on page load and after signin

### 2. Updated Server-Side Auth (`src/lib/supabase/server.ts`)
- Reads custom `sb-access-token` and `sb-refresh-token` cookies
- Manually sets the session using these tokens
- Now the server can authenticate users properly

### 3. Updated SignIn Form (`src/components/auth/SignInForm.tsx`)
- Uses client-side Supabase auth
- Calls `syncSessionToCookies()` after successful signin
- Ensures cookies are set before redirecting

### 4. Added Global Session Sync (`src/app/layout.tsx` + `src/components/SessionSyncWrapper.tsx`)
- Syncs session to cookies on every page load
- Ensures cookies stay fresh across navigation

### 5. Created Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)
- Refreshes Supabase auth sessions
- Required for proper authentication flow

## How to Test

1. **Sign Out Completely**
   - Go to your app and sign out
   - Clear browser cookies (optional but recommended)

2. **Sign In Again**
   - Use the signin form
   - This will now properly set the auth cookies

3. **Test Profile Save**
   - Go to /profile
   - Make any change
   - Click "Save Profile"
   - Should now work without errors!

## Files Modified

- ✅ `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`
- ✅ `src/components/auth/SignInForm.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/layout.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/SessionSyncWrapper.tsx` (NEW)
- ✅ `src/middleware.ts` (CREATED)
- ✅ `src/app/api/profile/update/route.ts` (Added logging)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Sign out
- [ ] Sign in with new flow
