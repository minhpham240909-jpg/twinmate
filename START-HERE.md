## 🆘 NEED HELP?

**If you get stuck:**
1. Check [REVISED-QUICK-START.md](REVISED-QUICK-START.md) - has detailed code examples
2. Test `/api/health` endpoint - shows what's working
3. Check Vercel logs - shows deployment errors
4. Run `npm run build` locally - catches issues early

**Common Issues:**
- "Rate limiting not working" → Check if `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` in Vercel
- "Build fails" → Run `npx prisma generate`
- "OpenAI errors" → Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Vercel
