## Recommendation: What to Build Next?

**For Clerva's use case, I'd recommend V2-V3 as the sweet spot:**

### Priority 1 (Next 2-3 weeks):
1. ✅ Enable streaming responses (better UX)
2. ✅ Add 5-8 more tools (progress tracking, concept explanation, resource suggestions)
3. ✅ Multi-query RAG (better search recall)
4. ✅ Enhanced memory (track entities, goals, deadlines)

### Priority 2 (1-2 months):
1. Multi-agent system (Study Coach + Tutor + Social agents)
2. Proactive background features (smart reminders, opportunity alerts)
3. Analytics dashboard
4. Better personalization (learning style adaptation)

### Priority 3 (3-4 months - if scaling):
1. Fine-tune on educational data
2. Multimodal (OCR notes, voice commands)
3. Infrastructure optimization (caching, queues)
4. Advanced observability

**You don't need V5** unless you're competing with Elicit/Consensus in research.

**Realistic "Max Level" for Clerva:** V3-V4 (~15,000-40,000 lines)
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Proactive intelligence
- Advanced personalization
- Multimodal capabilities
- This is where Notion AI / Canva AI likely are

**True "Max Level" (Research-grade):** V5 (~50,000-60,000+ lines)
- Only needed if becoming AI research company
- Diminishing returns for most apps
- Requires large team and budget

**Your AI agent is already production-ready at V1. V2-V3 would make it best-in-class for education.**
