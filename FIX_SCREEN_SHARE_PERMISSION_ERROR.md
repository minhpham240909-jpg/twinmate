# Fix: Screen Share Permission Error

## Problem

When clicking the screen share button, this error appeared:
```
AgoraRTCError PERMISSION_DENIED:
InvalidStateError: getDisplayMedia must be called from a user gesture handler.
```

## Root Cause

**Browser Security Requirement**: Browsers require that `getDisplayMedia()` (which requests screen sharing permission) must be called **directly and immediately** from a user action (button click).

**What was wrong**:
Our code was doing this:
1. User clicks button ✅
2. Check conditions ✅
3. **`await agoraClient.unpublish([videoTrack])`** ⏳ (async delay)
4. `await createScreenShareTrack()` ❌ (too late! browser rejects)

The `await unpublish()` created a delay between the user click and the screen share request. The browser saw this delay and thought it wasn't a direct user action, so it blocked it.

## Solution

**Call `createScreenShareTrack()` FIRST**, then unpublish the camera afterwards.

### Code Change

**File**: `src/lib/hooks/useVideoCall.ts`

**Before** (broken):
```typescript
// Check if connected
const agoraClient = clientRef.current
if (!agoraClient || !isConnected) {
  return
}

// Unpublish camera video track first ❌ (causes delay)
const videoTrack = localTracksRef.current.videoTrack
if (videoTrack) {
  await agoraClient.unpublish([videoTrack])  // ⏳ DELAY
}

// Create screen share track (TOO LATE)
const screenTrackResult = await createScreenShareTrack()  // ❌ Permission denied
```

**After** (fixed):
```typescript
// Check if connected
const agoraClient = clientRef.current
if (!agoraClient || !isConnected) {
  return
}

// Create screen share track FIRST ✅ (immediate after user click)
// Browser requires getDisplayMedia to be called directly from user gesture
const screenTrackResult = await createScreenShareTrack()  // ✅ Works!

// Now unpublish camera video track (after getting permission)
const videoTrack = localTracksRef.current.videoTrack
if (videoTrack) {
  await agoraClient.unpublish([videoTrack])
}
```

## Why This Works

### Browser's Perspective:

**Broken flow**:
```
User Click → Check conditions → Unpublish (async) → [DELAY] → Request screen share ❌
└─ Direct action ───────────────────────┘              └─ Not direct! BLOCKED
```

**Fixed flow**:
```
User Click → Check conditions → Request screen share ✅ → Unpublish
└─ Direct action ──────────────┘
```

The browser sees the screen share request happening immediately (within milliseconds) of the user click, so it allows it.

## Technical Details

### What is `getDisplayMedia()`?

It's the browser API that shows the screen/window picker:
```javascript
navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()
```

Agora's `createScreenVideoTrack()` calls this under the hood.

### Browser Security Rules

1. **Must be from user gesture**: Click, tap, keyboard press
2. **Must be immediate**: Within ~1 second of the gesture
3. **Cannot be delayed**: Async operations break the connection
4. **Cannot be programmatic**: `setTimeout()`, intervals, etc. won't work

### Why the Unpublish Delay Broke It

```typescript
await agoraClient.unpublish([videoTrack])
```

This is an **async network operation** that:
- Sends unpublish message to Agora servers
- Waits for acknowledgment
- Takes 100-500ms typically
- Breaks the "immediate user gesture" chain

## Order of Operations (Fixed)

1. **User clicks button** 👆
2. Check if already sharing (instant check) ✅
3. Check if someone else sharing (instant check) ✅
4. Check if connected (instant check) ✅
5. **Request screen share** 🖥️ (browser shows picker) ✅
6. User selects screen/window 👆
7. Browser grants permission ✅
8. Unpublish camera video 📹 (now safe to delay)
9. Publish screen share track 📡
10. Update UI state 🎨

## Impact

**Before Fix**:
- ❌ Screen sharing failed with permission error
- ❌ Error in console
- ❌ Users couldn't share screens
- ❌ Bad user experience

**After Fix**:
- ✅ Screen sharing works perfectly
- ✅ No errors
- ✅ Smooth user experience
- ✅ Camera properly switches off/on

## Testing

✅ **Tested Scenarios**:
- [x] Click screen share button - works
- [x] Press 'S' key - works
- [x] Multiple share cycles - works
- [x] Camera on before sharing - works
- [x] Camera off before sharing - works
- [x] No permission errors in console

## Other Code Not Affected

This change **only affects the order** of operations. Everything else works the same:
- ✅ Video still works
- ✅ Audio still works
- ✅ Mute/unmute still works
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts still work
- ✅ Other features unaffected

## Browser Compatibility

This fix works on all browsers:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Mobile browsers (where supported)

## Key Takeaway

🔑 **When requesting browser permissions** (camera, microphone, screen share):
- Call the permission request **as early as possible** in your function
- Don't put any `await` operations before it
- Keep the user gesture → permission request path **short and synchronous**

## Related Browser APIs with Same Requirement

These APIs also need immediate user gestures:
- `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` (camera/mic)
- `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()` (screen share)
- `document.requestFullscreen()` (fullscreen)
- `element.play()` (video/audio with sound)
- `Clipboard.write()` (clipboard access)
