## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push to GitHub (Triggers Auto-Deploy)

Open Terminal and run these commands:

```bash
cd "/Users/minhpham/Documents/minh project.html/clerva-app"

# Push your changes to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**If you need to authenticate:**
- Enter your GitHub username
- Enter your GitHub Personal Access Token (not password)
- If you don't have a token, create one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

---

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment

Your app should auto-deploy to Google Cloud. Check:

**Google Cloud Console:**
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Navigate to your project
3. Check:
   - **Cloud Run** → Services → Check deployment status
   - OR **App Engine** → Versions → Check new version deploying
4. Wait for status: ✅ **Serving** or **Deployed**

**Typical deployment time:** 2-5 minutes

---

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Once deployed, test your endpoints:

#### Test 1: List All Users
```bash
curl https://YOUR-DOMAIN.com/api/list-all-users
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "totalUsers": 3,
  "users": [...]
}
```

#### Test 2: Search for User
```bash
curl "https://YOUR-DOMAIN.com/api/test-search-users?query=Gia%20Khang"
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "found": 1,
  "results": [{
    "name": "Gia Khang Pham",
    ...
  }]
}
```

#### Test 3: AI Search
Open your app → AI chat:
```
Find Gia Khang Pham
```

Should successfully find and display the user! ✅

## 🔄 Alternative: Manual Deployment (If Auto-Deploy Doesn't Work)

### For Cloud Run:

```bash
cd "/Users/minhpham/Documents/minh project.html/clerva-app"

# Build and deploy
gcloud run deploy clerva-app \
  --source . \
  --region YOUR-REGION \
  --allow-unauthenticated

# Replace YOUR-REGION with your region (e.g., us-central1)
```

### For App Engine:

```bash
cd "/Users/minhpham/Documents/minh project.html/clerva-app"

# Deploy to App Engine
gcloud app deploy

# Follow prompts to confirm
```

---

## ✅ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:
- [x] Code changes committed
- [x] Database configured (RLS policies)
- [x] Test users created
- [x] Environment variables set in Google Cloud

After deploying:
- [ ] Push to GitHub successful
- [ ] Deployment completes (check Cloud Console)
- [ ] API endpoints return users
- [ ] AI search works
- [ ] No errors in logs

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Git push fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if you're logged in
git config user.name
git config user.email

# If needed, set them
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"

# Try push again with credentials
git push origin main
```

### Issue: Deployment fails

**Check:**
1. **Build logs** in Google Cloud Console
2. **Environment variables** are set correctly
3. **DATABASE_URL** points to correct Supabase database
4. **Node version** matches your local version

**Common fix:**
```bash
# Clear build cache and redeploy
gcloud run deploy clerva-app --source . --clear-build-cache
```

### Issue: Deployed but still returns 0 users

**Cause:** Wrong DATABASE_URL in production

**Fix:**
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Find your service (Cloud Run or App Engine)
3. Click "Edit & Deploy New Revision"
4. Check environment variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...@db.xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
   ```
5. Make sure it points to the SAME database where you:
   - Created test users
   - Added RLS policies

## 📊 What's Being Deployed

### Code Changes:
```
packages/ai-agent/src/tools/searchUsers.ts
  - Multi-term search logic
  - Splits "Gia Khang Pham" → ["Gia", "Khang", "Pham"]
  - Searches each term independently
  - Case-insensitive matching

src/app/api/test-search-users/route.ts
  - Same improved search logic
  - Test endpoint for debugging
```

### Database Changes (Already Applied):
```
✅ RLS policies allowing read access
✅ Test users: Gia Khang Pham, John Smith, Maria Garcia
✅ Profiles for all users
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Results After Deployment

### Search Queries That Work:
```
"Find Gia Khang Pham"     ✅
"Search for Gia Khang"    ✅
"Who is Gia?"             ✅
"Find John Smith"         ✅
"Search for Maria"        ✅
"Find users studying Math" ✅
```

### All Name Variations Work:
```
"Gia Khang Pham"  → Finds user ✅
"Gia Khang"       → Finds user ✅
"Gia"             → Finds user ✅
"Khang"           → Finds user ✅
