## 🔧 Google OAuth Setup (If Needed)

If Google signin doesn't work yet, you need to configure it in Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zuukijevgtcfsgylbsqj
2. Navigate to: **Authentication** → **Providers**
3. Click on **Google**
4. Toggle **Enable Sign in with Google**
5. Add your Google OAuth credentials:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
6. Add authorized redirect URLs:
   - Development: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - Production: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback`
7. Save changes

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test Signup:
1. Open: http://localhost:3000/auth/signup
2. Enter your real email (e.g., `yourname@gmail.com`)
3. Create a password (min 8 characters)
4. Click "Sign Up"
5. Check your email for verification link
6. Click verification link
7. Go to signin page and sign in

### Test Google OAuth:
1. Open: http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Complete Google authorization
4. Should redirect to dashboard automatically

---

## 📱 Email Verification

### How It Works:
1. User signs up with email
2. Supabase automatically sends verification email
3. Email contains a magic link
4. User clicks the link
5. Redirected to `/auth/callback`
6. Callback route confirms email
7. User can now sign in

### Email Template:
Supabase uses default email templates. You can customize them in:
**Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **Email Templates**

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Development vs Production:

**Development (localhost):**
- Email redirect: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
- Google OAuth redirect: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
- Supabase URL: `https://zuukijevgtcfsgylbsqj.supabase.co`

**Production (when you deploy):**
- Update redirect URLs in Supabase dashboard
- Add production domain to allowed URLs
- Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable

### Session Behavior:
- 0.5-2 second delay after signin is **NORMAL**
- This ensures cookies are properly set
- Full page reload guarantees clean auth state
- Users will barely notice this delay

### Email Verification:
- If email verification is enabled, users **MUST** verify email before signin
- Unverified users cannot sign in
- Supabase blocks signin attempts from unverified emails
- Verification emails sent automatically by Supabase
