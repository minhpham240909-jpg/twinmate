## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 2: Share link shows 404
**Possible Causes:**
1. Post was deleted
2. Post ID is incorrect
3. Migration not run

**Solution:** Check post exists and migration complete

### Issue 3: Native share not working
**Cause:** Browser doesn't support Web Share API
**Solution:** This is normal - fallback to copy link works automatically

### Issue 4: Three-dots menu doesn't close
**Cause:** State not updating
**Solution:** Refresh page, check console for errors

### Issue 5: Public share page shows "Unauthorized"
