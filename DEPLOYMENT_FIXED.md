# ✅ Vercel Build Error - FIXED!

## What Was Wrong
The build failed because Tailwind CSS was in `devDependencies` instead of `dependencies`.

## What I Fixed
Moved these to `dependencies`:
- `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- `tailwindcss`

## Status
✅ Fixed and pushed to GitHub
⏳ Vercel is auto-deploying now

## Next Steps
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel deployment
2. Check deployment status in Vercel dashboard
3. Test: https://clerva-app.vercel.app
4. Let me know if it works or if there are new errors!

🚀 The build should succeed now!
