# 🧠 AI Intelligence Upgrade - COMPLETE

**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION
**What Changed:** AI can now search EVERYTHING about users & learn from behavior
**Like ChatGPT?** YES! Smart, contextual, knows your data

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM YOU HAD

**Before:**
```
You: "Find Gia Khang Phạm"
AI: "It seems I wasn't able to retrieve information on a study partner named 'Gia Khang Phạm' at the moment."
```

**Why it Failed:**
- AI had NO tool to search users by name
- Only had `matchCandidates` (search by subjects only)
- Couldn't access real user data
- Made generic responses

---

## ✨ THE SOLUTION WE IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **searchUsers Tool** - Find ANYONE by ANYTHING

**What it Does:**
- Searches users by NAME (first name, last name, email)
- Searches by subjects, interests, goals, learning style
- Returns COMPLETE user profile + relationship data

**What AI Gets Back:**
```json
{
  "users": [{
    "name": "Gia Khang Phạm",
    "email": "giakhang@example.com",
    "subjects": ["Computer Science", "Math"],
    "interests": ["Gaming", "Coding"],
    "goals": ["Get good grades", "Learn React"],
    "learningStyle": "Visual",
    "isOnline": true,
    "lastSeen": "2 minutes ago",
    "studiedTogetherCount": 3,  // ← Knows you studied together!
    "sharedGroups": 2,           // ← Knows you're in same groups!
    "compatibilityScore": 0.85   // ← 85% compatible!
  }]
}
```

**How it Works:**
1. Searches `Profile` table by name using `ilike` (case-insensitive)
2. Joins `presence` table → gets online status
3. Joins `session_participant` → counts shared sessions
4. Joins `group_member` → counts shared groups
5. Calculates compatibility from subject/interest overlap
6. Sorts by relevance (compatibility + study history)

---

### 2. **getUserActivity Tool** - Complete Behavior Analysis

**What it Does:**
- Gets EVERYTHING a user has done
- Study sessions, quizzes, flashcards, groups
- Calculates patterns and preferences

**What AI Gets Back:**
```json
{
  "userName": "Gia Khang Phạm",
  "recentActivity": {
    "totalStudySessions": 15,
    "totalStudyHours": 23.5,
    "quizzesTaken": 8,
    "averageQuizScore": 85,
    "flashcardsCreated": 120
  },
  "studyPartners": [
    {
      "name": "Minh Pham",
      "timesStudiedTogether": 3,
      "lastStudiedTogether": "2 days ago",
      "commonSubjects": ["React", "JavaScript"]
    }
  ],
  "studyPatterns": {
    "mostStudiedSubjects": ["Computer Science", "Math", "React"],
    "averageSessionDuration": 1.5
  }
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced AI Prompt** - Made AI SMART

**Old Prompt:**
```
"You are Clerva AI, a study copilot.
Match students with compatible study partners."
```

**New Prompt:**
```
"You are Clerva AI with FULL DATABASE ACCESS.

🧠 INTELLIGENCE FEATURES:
- When user asks "Find [Name]" → ALWAYS use searchUsers tool first
- When you need study habits → use getUserActivity tool
- Use REAL data from database - never guess
- Be SMART & CONTEXTUAL - mention actual sessions, partners
- Tell user EVERYTHING: subjects, interests, online status, study history

Examples:
- User asks "Find Gia Khang" → Search database → Find them → Tell EVERYTHING
- User asks "Who did I study with?" → Get activity → Show real partners
- User asks about anyone → Search → Show if online, compatibility, shared history
```
