# Study Session Rebuild - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully rebuilt the study session system with a new waiting lobby flow that separates video calling from DM/group calls and provides access to all study features during the call.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes
**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added `WAITING` status to `SessionStatus` enum
- Added `waitingStartedAt` field (when lobby was created)
- Added `waitingExpiresAt` field (30 minutes after creation)
- Changed `startedAt` to nullable (set only when host clicks "Start")
- Updated default status from `SCHEDULED` to `WAITING`

**Migration File**: `add_waiting_lobby_schema.sql`
- SQL migration to add new fields and enum values
- **NOTE**: Migration needs to be applied to database before testing

### 2. New User Flow

#### Old Flow:
```
Create Session → Dashboard Page → Start Video Call
```

#### New Flow:
```
Create Session → Waiting Lobby (30 min timeout) → Study Call Page (with all features)
                       ↓
                (Auto-delete if not started)
```

### 3. Backend APIs Created/Updated

#### Updated:
- **`/api/study-sessions/create`**
  - Now creates sessions in `WAITING` status
  - Sets `waitingExpiresAt` to 30 minutes from creation
  - `startedAt` is null until session is started

#### New:
- **`/api/study-sessions/[sessionId]/start-call` (POST)**
  - Only callable by session creator
  - Validates session is in WAITING status
  - Checks if waiting lobby has expired
  - Updates status to ACTIVE and sets startedAt
  - Notifies all invited participants

- **`/api/study-sessions/cleanup-expired` (GET/POST)**
  - Deletes all WAITING sessions where waitingExpiresAt < now
  - Can be called manually or by a cron job
  - Returns list of deleted sessions

### 4. Frontend Pages

#### A. Waiting Lobby Page
**Path**: `/study-sessions/[sessionId]/lobby`

**Features**:
- ✅ Countdown timer showing time until expiration (30 minutes)
- ✅ Session details display (title, description, subject, goals, etc.)
- ✅ Participants list with online/offline status
- ✅ Real-time chat while waiting
- ✅ "Start Studying" button (only visible to creator)
- ✅ Real-time updates when session starts (redirects everyone to call page)
- ✅ Auto-redirect if session expires
- ✅ Auto-redirect to call page if session is already ACTIVE

**User Experience**:
- Creator sees "Start Studying" button
- Participants see "Waiting for [host name] to start the session..."
- All participants can chat while waiting
- When creator clicks start, everyone is automatically redirected to the call page

#### B. Study Call Page (NEW - Different from DM/Group calls)
**Path**: `/study-sessions/[sessionId]/call`

**Layout**: Split screen with resizable panels
- **Left Side (Video)**: Floating/resizable video call area (1/3 or full width)
- **Right Side (Features)**: Tabbed interface with study features (2/3 width)

**Features**:
- ✅ Video call with all controls (mute, video, screen share, leave)
- ✅ Timer tab (full session timer with controls)
- ✅ Goals tab (view and manage session goals)
- ✅ Chat tab (session chat)
- ✅ Participants count in header
- ✅ Live status indicator
- ✅ Toggle features panel (can collapse to full-screen video)
- ✅ Quick access buttons when panel is collapsed

**Key Differences from DM/Group Video Calls**:
- Integrated study features alongside video
- Session-specific timer and goals
- Persistent during entire study session
- Auto-joins video call on page load
- **Does NOT affect DM/Group video calls** (separate implementation)

### 5. Flow Updates

#### Create Session:
```javascript
// Old: router.push(`/study-sessions/${sessionId}`)
// New:
router.push(`/study-sessions/${sessionId}/lobby`)
```

#### Accept Invite:
```javascript
// Old: router.push(`/study-sessions/${sessionId}`)
// New:
router.push(`/study-sessions/${sessionId}/lobby`)
// (Lobby page handles redirect to call if already started)
```

### 6. Real-time Features

#### Waiting Lobby:
- Presence tracking (who's online in the lobby)
- Real-time session status updates (redirects when status changes to ACTIVE)
- Real-time chat messages
- Countdown timer (client-side with auto-redirect on expiration)

#### Study Call Page:
- Auto-joins video call on load
- Real-time participant video/audio
- Feature panel can be toggled during call

## 🎯 Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. **Apply Database Migration WITH RLS Security**:

   **RECOMMENDED: Use Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor**

   a. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard

   b. Select your project (clerva-app)

   c. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)

   d. Click **"New Query"**

   e. Copy and paste the **entire contents** of:
      `COMPLETE_WAITING_LOBBY_MIGRATION.sql`

   f. Click **"Run"** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

   g. Verify success: Should see "Success. No rows returned"

   **Alternative: Using Prisma (doesn't include RLS)**
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   # Then manually run COMPLETE_WAITING_LOBBY_MIGRATION.sql for RLS
   ```

2. **Regenerate Prisma Client** (already done):
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Test Flow:

#### Test 1: Create Session and Waiting Lobby
1. Go to `/study-sessions`
2. Click "New Session"
3. Fill in session details and create
4. **Expected**: Redirects to `/study-sessions/[id]/lobby`
5. **Verify**:
   - Countdown timer shows 30:00 and counts down
   - Session details are displayed
   - You see "Start Studying" button (as creator)
   - You appear in participants list
   - Chat is functional

#### Test 2: Invite and Join
1. In waiting lobby, click "Invite Partners" (if available, or invite via another method)
2. On another browser/incognito tab, login as invited user
3. Accept invitation
4. **Expected**: Redirects to waiting lobby
5. **Verify**:
   - Both users appear in participants list
   - Both users can chat
   - Invited user sees "Waiting for [creator name]..."
   - No "Start Studying" button for invited user

#### Test 3: Start Session
1. As creator, click "Start Studying"
2. **Expected**: Both users redirect to `/study-sessions/[id]/call`
3. **Verify**:
   - Video call starts automatically
   - Can toggle features panel (Timer, Goals, Chat)
   - Video controls work (mute, video, screen share)
   - All study features accessible during call

#### Test 4: 30-Minute Expiration
1. Create a session
2. Wait in lobby (or manually update `waitingExpiresAt` in database to past time)
3. **Expected**: Auto-redirect to `/study-sessions` with "Session has expired" message
4. Run cleanup API: `GET/POST /api/study-sessions/cleanup-expired`
5. **Verify**: Expired session is deleted from database

#### Test 5: Join Active Session
1. Create session and start it (go to call page)
2. Invite someone while in the call
3. Invited user accepts
4. **Expected**: Invited user goes directly to `/study-sessions/[id]/call` (skips lobby)
5. **Verify**: Both users in video call with features accessible

### Known Issues to Check:
