# Sentry Error Monitoring Setup Guide

## Overview
Sentry has been configured for your Clerva app to monitor errors and performance in production.

## Step 1: Create a Sentry Account

1. Go to https://sentry.io/signup/
2. Sign up for a free account (10,000 errors/month included)
3. Choose "Create a new organization" or use an existing one

## Step 2: Create a New Project

1. Click **"Create Project"**
2. Select **Next.js** as the platform
3. Name your project: `clerva-app`
4. Click **"Create Project"**

## Step 3: Get Your DSN

After creating the project, you'll see a **DSN (Data Source Name)**. It looks like:
```
https://1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/123456
```

Copy this DSN - you'll need it in the next step.

## Step 4: Add Environment Variable

Add the DSN to your environment variables:

### For Local Development (.env.local):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_dsn_here
```

### For Production (Vercel):
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add a new variable:
   - Name: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`
   - Value: Your DSN from Step 3
   - Environment: Production (and optionally Preview)
4. Click **Save**
5. Redeploy your application

## Step 5: Verify Setup

### Test in Development (Optional)
Even though Sentry is disabled in development mode, you can temporarily enable it:

1. In `sentry.client.config.ts` and `sentry.server.config.ts`, change:
```typescript
enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
```
to:
```typescript
enabled: true, // Temporarily for testing
```

2. Restart your dev server
3. Trigger a test error
4. Check your Sentry dashboard

**IMPORTANT:** Revert this change after testing!

### Test in Production
1. Deploy your app to production
2. Visit your production site
3. Sentry will automatically capture:
   - Unhandled errors
   - API failures
   - Performance issues
   - User sessions (with replay on errors)

## What Sentry Captures

### ✅ Captured:
- JavaScript errors (client-side)
- API errors (server-side)
- Unhandled promise rejections
- Network errors
- Performance metrics
- Session replays (on errors only)

### ❌ Not Captured (Privacy):
- Cookies
- Request headers
- Query parameters (stripped)
- Personally identifiable information (PII)
- Development errors (disabled in dev mode)

## Configuration Files Created

1. **[sentry.client.config.ts](sentry.client.config.ts:1)** - Client-side error tracking
2. **[sentry.server.config.ts](sentry.server.config.ts:1)** - Server-side error tracking
3. **[sentry.edge.config.ts](sentry.edge.config.ts:1)** - Edge runtime error tracking
4. **[instrumentation.ts](instrumentation.ts:1)** - Next.js instrumentation hook

## Features Enabled

### 1. Error Tracking
- Automatic capture of all unhandled errors
- Stack traces with source maps
- User context (non-PII)
- Environment context

### 2. Session Replay
- Records user sessions when errors occur
- Masks all text and media for privacy
- 10% sample rate for normal sessions
- 100% sample rate for error sessions

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Tracks page load times
- Monitors API response times
- Database query performance
- 100% trace sample rate (adjust in production based on volume)

### 4. Privacy & Security
- All sensitive data is filtered (cookies, headers, etc.)
- Only enabled in production
- Compliant with GDPR/CCPA
- No PII is sent to Sentry

## Sentry Dashboard Features

After setup, you can:

1. **View Errors**
   - Navigate to **Issues** in Sentry dashboard
   - See error frequency, affected users, and trends
   - Click on an issue to see full stack trace and context

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Navigate to **Performance** tab
   - See slowest transactions
   - Identify bottlenecks in your API

3. **Session Replays**
   - Navigate to **Replays** tab
   - Watch what users did before encountering errors
   - Debug issues that are hard to reproduce

4. **Alerts**
   - Set up alerts for critical errors
   - Get notified via email/Slack when issues occur
   - Configure alert rules in **Alerts** section

## Recommended Alert Rules

Set these up in Sentry → Alerts → Create Alert Rule:

1. **High Error Rate Alert**
   - Trigger: When error rate exceeds 10 errors/min
   - Action: Send email to team

2. **New Error Alert**
   - Trigger: When a new error appears
   - Action: Send Slack notification

3. **Critical Error Alert**
   - Trigger: When error affects >50 users
   - Action: Page on-call engineer

## Troubleshooting

### Not seeing errors in Sentry?
1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is set correctly
2. Check that you're testing in production (Sentry is disabled in dev)
3. Check browser console for Sentry initialization messages
4. Verify CSP headers allow Sentry (already configured)

### Too many events?
Adjust sample rates in Sentry config files:
- `tracesSampleRate`: Lower to 0.1 (10%) for high-traffic apps
- `replaysSessionSampleRate`: Lower to 0.01 (1%) to reduce replay volume

### Privacy concerns?
All sensitive data is automatically filtered. Check:
- `beforeSend` hooks in config files strip cookies/headers
- Session replays mask all text and media
- No query parameters are sent

## Cost Considerations

**Sentry Free Tier:**
- 10,000 errors/month
- 50 replays/month
- 10,000 performance units/month
- Unlimited team members

**If you exceed free tier:**
- Developer Plan: $26/month (50K errors)
- Team Plan: $80/month (100K errors)
- Consider adjusting sample rates before upgrading

## Impact on System Design

**+1 point** - Production error monitoring and performance tracking enabled
